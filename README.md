# HAPPY THANKSGIVING!

---

Maybe this thanksgiving your family/friends aren't together.
Or maybe y'll just can't stand a conversation and prefer technology as a medium 


Either way, this is the solution for you. 


A form to submit what each individual is thankful for, all of which are stored in the backend and can be accessed, so now y'all all can realize everything great going on.

For the record, this was just a simple, thanksgiving holiday themed project, not an actual product.
